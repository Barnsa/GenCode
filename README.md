# GenCode
A bunch of code I wrote for GenCode Experience Days to teach people the begining of Python programming using BBC Micro:Bit.  
Some of the code is borrowed from the micropython webpage and the resources is referenced in the lessons, but for respect and kudos you can find the resource [here.](https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/introduction.html)

### How to use this repository
If you want to use any of the code in this repository then you are more than welcome to use any of it. The parts that I have borrowed are released on the public domain anyway, and I would be honoured to see my code used anywhere else. 

### Students
If you are a student that has made your way here, to use any of the python code you should copy and paste the code from any file only after you have clicked on the 'raw' button. Copy and pasting code not in it's raw form often has lots of errors and added newlines that you didn't ask for. If you have any issues then please feel free to post in the 'issues' section and I will try to answer any of your questions.


### Lesson contributions
If you want to contribute code and expand on the lessons then please post on the issues page, make a pull request, and get coding!! I'll provide some guidlines to best coding practices if it becomes too much of an issue going forward, but as a general rule make sure you have lots of comments that would explain code to someone who has never coded before, as that is the intended audience.
